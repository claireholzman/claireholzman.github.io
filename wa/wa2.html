    <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Claire</strong>, I am a <em>senior</em> at CU Boulder.
        My major is Business with an emphasis in Marketing and a minor in CTD. Growing up I have lived in California, New York, Idaho, Florida, Connecticut, and France. I went to high school in Miami, FL.
        I am sad that I will be graduating in May but I am excited for the new chapter. My dream is to work in sports marketing or sales.
        My favorite Youtube video is <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=323v_FtWqvo">Here</a>
